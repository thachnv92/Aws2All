# <center>0.1. Install or upgrade the AWS CLI on Engineer machine</center>

# Guide
To call CodeDeploy commands from the AWS CLI on a local development machine, you must install the AWS CLI. CodeDeploy commands first became available in version 1.6.1 of the AWS CLI. CodeDeploy commands for working with on-premises instances became available in 1.7.19 of the AWS CLI.

If you have an older version of the AWS CLI installed, you must upgrade it so the CodeDeploy commands are available. Call `aws --version` to check the version.


For installation instructions, expand the section for your operating system to install or upgrade the AWS CLI.
